## Completed Items

- Project structure set up
- README.md created with feature list and technical details

## Additional Notes

- Consider implementing offline-first architecture early in development to ensure robust functionality without internet connection
- Prioritize performance optimization techniques such as lazy loading and efficient data caching
- Research and plan for potential integration with Samsung Health and Google Fit
- Keep privacy and data protection in mind throughout development, especially when implementing backup and social features

This updated backlog reflects the current state of the project and prioritizes the core functionality of the app. High-priority items focus on essential features like step counting, basic UI, and data storage. Medium-priority items enhance the user experience and add key features mentioned in the README. Low-priority items are additional features that can be implemented later to expand the app's functionality.

The backlog also notes completed items and provides additional considerations for development. As the project progresses, this backlog should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changing priorities and completed work.
