Here's a sprint plan based on the current product backlog and project state:

```markdown
# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal
Implement the core step counting functionality and set up the basic infrastructure for the Steps Tracker app.

## Selected User Stories/Tasks (Priority Order)

1. Implement core step counting functionality (High Priority)
   - Estimate: 8 story points
   - Dependencies: None
   - Risks: Ensuring accuracy across different Android devices

2. Set up Room Database for local data storage (High Priority)
   - Estimate: 5 story points
   - Dependencies: None
   - Risks: Potential performance issues with large datasets

3. Implement MVVM architecture (High Priority)
   - Estimate: 5 story points
   - Dependencies: None
   - Risks: Team's familiarity with MVVM pattern

4. Develop basic UI using Jetpack Compose (High Priority)
   - Estimate: 8 story points
   - Dependencies: Core step counting functionality
   - Risks: Learning curve for Jetpack Compose

5. Implement background service for continuous step tracking (Medium Priority)
   - Estimate: 5 story points
   - Dependencies: Core step counting functionality
   - Risks: Battery drain, compliance with Android background execution limits

6. Add customizable step counting sensitivity (Medium Priority)
   - Estimate: 3 story points
   - Dependencies: Core step counting functionality
   - Risks: Balancing accuracy and user preference

7. Implement dark mode support (Medium Priority)
   - Estimate: 3 story points
   - Dependencies: Basic UI development
   - Risks: Ensuring consistent look across all screens

## Total Story Points: 37

## Definition of Done

```

This sprint plan focuses on establishing the core functionality and infrastructure of the Steps Tracker app. It prioritizes the essential features while also including some medium-priority items that enhance the user experience. The plan takes into account the current project state and aims to create a solid foundation for future development.

The selected tasks cover a mix of backend and frontend work, ensuring that by the end of the sprint, we'll have a basic working version of the app with step counting, data storage, and a simple UI. The inclusion of MVVM architecture and Room Database setup will provide a robust structure for future feature additions.

The Definition of Done ensures that all implemented features meet quality standards, are well-tested, and provide a good user experience across different devices. This sprint sets the stage for rapid iteration and feature expansion in subsequent sprints.
